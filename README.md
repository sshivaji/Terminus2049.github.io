What is Endpoint Star Program
The Terminus Endpoint Star Project is a site built on the GitHub open platform for backing up deleted articles on platforms such as WeChat and Weibo. Outside the firewall, there are also websites like China Digital Times, GreatFire, FreeWeibo, FreeWeChat, Wall and Book that make articles and backups, but it is not easy to spread the network inside the wall.

At the same time, we operate a forum 2049bbs that can be registered without a mobile phone number and email. Welcome to discuss freely.

Note: Endpoint Star does not include content that has not been harmonized by the Chinese government.
